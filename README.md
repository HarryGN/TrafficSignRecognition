Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Learning on Self-Driving Cars
##introduction
Self-driving cars are autonomous decision-making systems. They process data from sensors such 
as cameras, LiDAR, RADAR, GPS, or inertia sensors. This data is then modeled using deep 
learning algorithms, making decisions relevant to the car's environment. [1] This project
investigates how image recognition is used in self-driving cars. How deep learning, especially 
convolutional neural networks, models traffic sign recognition. In this project, we are going to 
focus more on the image taken by the camera therefore computer vision is crucial. Thus, we are 
taking CNNs as our prior choice. The traffic dataset we will be using is the Canadian traffic sign 
data set.

Interesting things happen when the team realizes that noise in the images is inevitable. [Figure 1: 
Example of noise]. Image filtering is then an add-on to this traffic sign recognition feature. In 
some extreme weather and corner cases, noise would cause a certain wrong output of the 
algorithm and the teamâ€™s goal is to propose an algorithm composed of three processing stages: 
detection, pictogram extraction, image filtering and classification. [2]

This is an overall though map of how this CNN is implemented when spatial transformers have 
been deployed -> determine noise (unique feature here) and do image filtering -> uses CNN for 
extrusion and then uses a linear classifier [3]
